# PEPSE: Precise Environmental Procedural Simulator Extraordinaire

## Project Overview

PEPSE (Precise Environmental Procedural Simulator Extraordinaire) is a simulation game designed for object-oriented programming practice. The simulation includes a modular and procedurally generated world with elements such as day-night cycles, trees with physics-based interactions, and an avatar that can explore and interact with the environment. The goal is to create an engaging survival-style game with dynamic, procedurally generated features while practicing various object-oriented programming concepts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several packages:

- **pepse**: Main game manager package.
- **pepse.util**: Contains utility classes, such as color variation generators.
- **pepse.world**: Responsible for world generation and management.
- **pepse.world.daynight**: Implements the day-night cycle mechanics.
- **pepse.world.trees**: Manages the creation and behavior of trees in the game.

## Features

1. **Day-Night Cycle**: A realistic cycle with dynamic lighting and transition effects. The environment changes from day to night, with the sky's color and brightness gradually adjusting based on the time of day.
   
2. **Procedural Terrain Generation**: Terrain is generated procedurally to create an infinite world. Different terrains are rendered, simulating hills and flatlands.

3. **Dynamic Trees**: Trees are procedurally placed and interact with the physics engine. Leaves can sway in the wind, and fruits can grow on trees and be collected by the avatar.

4. **Avatar Movement**: The player controls an avatar that can move left and right, jump, and interact with objects in the world.

5. **Fruit Collection**: The avatar can collect fruit from trees, which can restore energy. Each fruit disappears after being collected but regenerates after a set period.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PEPSE.git
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="pepse.PepseGameManager"
   ```

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move the avatar left and right.
- Press the space bar to make the avatar jump.
- The avatar's energy will deplete as it moves and jumps. Collect fruits to replenish energy.

## Code Breakdown

### 1. **Day-Night Cycle**
- The day-night cycle is controlled by the `pepse.world.daynight.Night` class. A transition smoothly changes the opacity of a black overlay to simulate nightfall. 

### 2. **Terrain Generation**
- The terrain is generated by the `pepse.world.Terrain` class, which creates blocks of ground using procedural noise algorithms to simulate hills.

### 3. **Trees**
- The `pepse.world.trees.Tree` class generates trees randomly within a certain range, using a predefined probability.
- The `pepse.world.trees.Leaf` class handles the visual and physical properties of tree leaves, including the ability to sway with the wind.

### 4. **Avatar**
- The `pepse.entities.Avatar` class defines the avatar's movement and interaction with the environment, including jumping, running, and collecting fruits.

## Future Work

- **Wind Simulation**: Add a more complex wind model to make leaves and fruits behave more naturally.
- **Weather Effects**: Introduce rain or snow to enhance the survival experience.
- **Enhanced AI**: Implement AI for other characters or creatures in the game world.
